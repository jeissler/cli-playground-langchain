# 🧪 LangChain CLI Playground

A tiny, experimental CLI for exploring **LangChain** concepts in a hands-on way.  
Think of it as a sandbox for testing ideas, chaining nodes and seeing how prompts, memory and RAG all work together. Also connected to LangGraph for tool call observability. 

## ✨ Features

- 💬 **Interactive CLI** – Chat with an LLM, switch users and change languages mid-session
- 🧠 **Stateful Memory** – Simple per-user conversation history for context persistence
- 📚 **RAG Pipeline** – Load web docs via `@link`, embed them and use them in answers 
- 🔄 **Custom StateGraph** – Modular steps for query reformulation, retrieval, generation and playful post-processing (yes, random fish facts 🐟)
- 🎯 **Prompt Playground** – Test LangChain Hub prompts and template tweaks on the fly

## 🚀 Why It’s Cool

Perfect for learning how:
- Messages, embeddings and prompts fit together
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation works in practice
- To build and extend **LangChain StateGraph** flows quickly
